Resolve this merge conflict

---

_**Assistant**_

To resolve your merge conflict, I need to see the actual conflict markers (e.g., `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in the file(s) where the conflict occurred. The information provided does not show the conflict markers or the conflicting sections.

**Next step:**  
Please do one of the following:
- Paste the section of the file (or files) that contains the merge conflict markers here.
- Tell me the file path(s) where the merge conflict exists, and I can help you step-by-step to resolve it.

Once I have the actual conflicting content, I can provide a precise, safe, and clean resolution for you!
